Energy price prediction for Greece

In this project I will try to predict the energy price of Greece in order to help the company with the cash flow planning.

We will need historical data of the energy price, wind , solar , lignite , gas and renewable quantities. We can find them through data collection in the site of HenEx.

Machine Learning algorithms used in this project are Random Forest , XGBoost and Prophet time series.

Of course, it is very hard to predict a price whether it is energy price or stock price, but this project it can be used as supporting tool in order to help the cash flow planning using more scientific tools rather than empirical knowledge.
